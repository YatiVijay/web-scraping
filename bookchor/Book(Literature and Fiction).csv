At the height of the Cold War, Boysie is sent on a routine mission to America.

In San Diego, he will be the official British observer for the test-fire of America’s latest nuclear missile: The Trepholite.

But the Soviets have other plans.

A double of Boysie has been sent into the field.

And very soon Boysie is embroiled in a game of bluff and double-bluff involving a holocaustic missile, a slick con man - and Vladimir Solev, an deadly opponent and yet also a man in whom Boysie sees something of himself.

Along the way, Boysie is mixed up with two gorgeous women - the sultry Priscilla Braddock Fairchild and the luscious Chicory Triplehouse.

As he adventures across the United States, Boysie must dodge bullets, deadly predators and jealous women.

And as he arrives in San Diego the clock is ticking and Operation Understrike is under way.

‘Understrike’ is the second in the series of highly acclaimed spy novels featuring cowardly secret agent, Boysie Oakes. It is perfect for fans of classic British spy fiction, including Ian Fleming, Len Deighton, and Desmond Bagley.

Before coming an author of fiction in the early 1960’s John Gardner was variously a stage magician, a Royal Marine officer and a journalist. In all Gardner has fifty-four novels to his credit, including Maestro, which was the New York Times book of the year. He was also invited by Ian Fleming’s literary copyright holders to write a series of continuation James Bond novels, which proved to be so successful that instead of the contracted three books he went on to publish some fourteen titles, including Licence Renewed and Icebreaker. Having lived in the Republic of Ireland, the United States and the UK, John Gardner sadly died in August of 2007 having just completed his third novel in the Moriarty trilogy, Conan Doyle’s eponymous villain of the Sherlock Holmes series.

In Brief Candle in the Dark he continues his autobiography, following the threads that have run through the second half of his life so far and homing in on the key individuals, institutions and ideas that inspired and motivated him.rnrnHe paints a vivid picture, coloured with wit, anecdote and digression, of the twenty-five postgraduate years he spent teaching at Oxford. He pays affectionate tribute to past colleagues and students, recalling with characteristic wry humour the idiosyncrasies of an establishment steeped in ancient tradition and arcane ritual while also recording his respect for the profound commitment to learning and discovery that lies at its core. He invites us to share the life of a travelling scientist, from fieldwork on the Panama Canal to conferences of stratospheric eminence in exotic locations in the company of some of the most prominent – and some of the most eccentric – of the world’s scientific luminaries. And he describes his experiences with his many publishers, television producers, interviewers and partners in debate, not least in the heady period when, after publication of The God Delusion in 2006, he is dubbed the world’s most outspoken and controversial atheist.rnrnMost important of all, for the first time he reviews with fresh and stimulating insights the evolving narrative of his ideas about science over the course of his highly distinguished career as thinker, teacher and writer.

In this candid and insightful book, she invites us to join her in a look back at the people, places and events that have shaped her life. It is the journey of a heart in search of enlightenment. With her trademark effervescent humour, Goldie tells us about the lessons she's learned and the wisdom she feels she's been given. Not a Hollywood 'tell-all', A Lotus Grows in the Mud is rather a very personal reflection on one woman's life: Goldie's delight in her father's spirited spontaneity; the confidence instilled in her by her mother; the unexpected gifts of comfort from strangers many miles from home; and the joy of being a daughter, a sister, a lover and a parent. This is Goldie's chance to talk about everything from anger and fear to love, compassion, integrity, friendship, the importance of family and the challenges of show business. Goldie writes about her younger self - the little girl who felt like an ugly duckling - and growing up in suburbia, dreaming of becoming a ballerina. She takes us on a tour through her go-go dancing years in 1960s New York, her phenomenal success on TV's Rowan & Martin's Laugh-in, and then to the world of Hollywood stardom and her extraordinary experiences in films like the Oscar-winning Cactus Flower, Swing Shift, and Private Benjamin. In A Lotus Grows in the Mud Goldie speaks of her relationship with her family - partner Kurt Russell, her children Kate Hudson, Oliver Hudson and Wyatt Russell, and her stepson Boston - her growing faith, her curiosity about the future, and her unquenchable thirst for knowledge and understanding. Most of all, it is a trip back through a life well lived by a woman well loved.",RS. 368,RS. 669,Bantam Press,464
